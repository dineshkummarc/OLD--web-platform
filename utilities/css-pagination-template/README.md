CSS Pagination Template
=======================

This is a prototype JavaScript implementation for the [CSS Pagination Template Module](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-page-template/Overview.src.html) proposal for the W3C.

About
-----

The [CSS Pagination Template Module](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-page-template/Overview.src.html) defines a way for developers to paginate regular HTML elements into multiple virtual pages. Developers can declare the layout for these pages using templates defined CSS. This eliminates the need for unnecessary HTML placeholder elements for layout, which can be replaced by the templates defined in CSS.

CSS Pagination Template also provides a way to layout content collected into named flows, part of the [CSS Regions Module](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-regions/). Pages based on templates are generated as many times as necessary until the named flow content is fully rendered.

Usage
----- 
Check out the samples under the demo/ folder using a [WebKit nightly](http://nightly.webkit.org/) browser.

Requirements
-----
The prototype and demos are expected to work with the latest [WebKit nightly build](http://nightly.webkit.org/). CSS Regions support is required.
