CSS Shaders Samples
===================

About
-----

CSS Shaders bring cinematic visual effects to HTML, using simple CSS syntax. 
They expand the visual effects and interactivity possible with Web content. 
We think CSS shaders can be both visually pleasing and, perhaps more importantly, 
provide enhanced user experience by offering very organic and natural user 
interaction feedback.

We have put together a set of demos for you. They showcase some of the concepts
we [propose](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/filters/index.html) with CSS Shaders.

Requirements
------------

All the samples in this folder require [Adobe's prototype build](https://github.com/adobe/webkit/tree/may2012-f2f-prototype). We are looking forward to upstreaming the changes to WebKit in the following weeks.
